> My professional background encompasses being a skilled full-stack developer and a Cyber Security Analyst, with a particular interest in cloud-based backend systems. Throughout my previous roles, I successfully operated within strict deadlines, showcased creative thinking, and effectively managed high-pressure situations. These experiences have honed my ability to collaborate with team members, communicate effectively, and approach problem-solving in an organized and logical manner.

I possess the expertise to deploy and maintain applications, and I excel at conveying information clearly. As a team player, I actively contribute to collective goals and exhibit excellent communication skills. I am always eager to learn, grow, and enhance my abilities in an environment that values teamwork, trust, and personal development.

In addition to my professional pursuits, I have a passion for music. I have played the electric bass guitar professionally for several years and continue to indulge in playing blues and jazz whenever I'm not engrossed in coding or configuring servers.
